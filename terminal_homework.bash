Terminal Practice

Write the answer to each command at the bottom your terminal_homework.bash You can copy a template of each command prompt from the first_bash_instructions.bash file and then copy paste your answers below each prompt

Episode X: A New Terminal
A long time ago in a unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to enterâ€¦ The Terminal.

Follow the instructions below using all the console commands introduced in Fundamentals, class, or that you find on your own.

You can do each prompt/command one by one or

// *************************************
Bonus Challenges (Optional)
// *************************************

Try doing the following:

Try applying one command to multiple files at once.
Try applying one command to all files in a single directory (where necessery)
Try applying one command to all files that match a pattern.
Find and use command line shortcuts.
Try using a mix of absolute and relative paths (there is a section on absolute pathing in today's Terminal lesson markdown).

// ***********************************
Part I: Set the Scene
// ***********************************

-- Code and Copy your working code into the terminal_homework.bash file
touch terminal_homework.bash

-- Open the Terminal app

-- Create a new directory on your Desktop called galaxy_far_far_away and enter it via terminal
cd ~
mkdir galaxy_far_far_away
cd galaxy_far_far_away

-- Create a directory called death_star, and make the following files inside of it:
mkdir death_star
touch darth_vader.txt
touch princess_leia.txt
touch storm_trooper.txt

-- In galaxy_far_far_away, make a directory named tatooine and create the following files in it:
cd ..
mkdir tatooine
cd tatooine
touch luke.txt
touch ben_kenobi.txt

-- Inside of tatooine make a directory called millenium_falcon, and in it create:
mkdir millenium_falcon
touch han_solo.txt
touch chewbaca.txt

// ***********************************
Part II: mv - rename
// ***********************************

-- You can rename a file using the mv command.

-- For example, rename file1.txt to file2.txt
-- mv file1.txt file2.txt

-- Rename ben_kenobi.txt to obi_wan.txt.
mv ben_kenobi.txt obi_wan.txt

// *********************************
Part II: cp - copy
// *********************************

-- You can copy a file from one location to another using the cp command.

-- For example, copy file1.txt to its parent directory:

-- cp file1.txt ..
-- And, copy file1.txt to a sibling directory:
-- cp file1.txt ../some_directory

-- Finally, copy file1.txt to a child directory.
-- cp file1.txt some_directory

-- Copy storm_trooper.txt from death_star to tatooine
cp storm_trooper.txt ../tatooine

Part IV: mv - move
-- You can use the mv command to move files from one location to another

-- For example, move a file from its current location to the parent directory:

-- mv file1.txt ..
-- And, move a file from its current location to a sibling directory:

-- mv file1.txt ../some_directory
-- Finally, move a file from its current location to a child directory:
-- mv file1.txt some_directory
-- You can also move directories into other directories using the same syntax

-- Move luke.txt and obi_wan.txt to the millenium_falcon
mv luke.txt luke.txt ./millenium_falcon
mv luke.txt obi_wan.txt ./millenium_falcon

-- Move millenium_falcon out of tatooine and into galaxy_far_far_away
mv millenium_falcon/ ..

-- Move millenium_falcon into death_star
mv millenium_falcon/ ./death_star/

-- Move princess_leia.txt into the millenium_falcon
 mv princess_leia.txt ./millenium_falcon/

// ***************************************
Part V: rm - remove
// ***************************************

-- You can use rm to delete a file.
-- For example, delete a file:
-- rm file1.txt

-- Delete obi_wan.txt
rm obi_wan.txt

// ****************************************
Part VI: all together
// ****************************************

-- In galaxy_far_far_away, make a directory called yavin_4
mkdir yavin_4

-- Move the millenium_falcon out of the death_star and into yavin_4
mv millenium_falcon/ ./yavin_4

-- Make a directory in yavin_4 called x_wing
mkdir x_wing

-- Move princess_leia.txt to yavin_4 and luke.txt to x_wing
mv princess_leia.txt ..
mv luke.txt ./x_wing

-- Move the millenium_falcon and x_wing out of yavin_4 and into galaxy_far_far_away
mv millenium_falcon/ ..
mv x_wing/ ..

-- In death_star, create directories for tie_fighter_1, tie_fighter_2 and tie_fighter_3
mkdir tie_fighter_1 tie_fighter_2 tie_fighter_3

-- Move darth_vader.txt into tie_fighter_1
mv darth_vader.txt ./tie_fighter_1

-- Make a copy of storm_trooper.txt in both tie_fighter_2 and tie_fighter_3
cp storm_trooper.txt ./tie_fighter_2 
cp storm_trooper.txt ./tie_fighter_3

-- Move all of the tie_fighters out of the death_star and into galaxy_far_far_away
mv tie_fighter_1 ..
mv tie_fighter_2 ..
mv tie_fighter_3 ..

// ***********************************
Part VII: rm -r - remove directories
// ***********************************
--Be careful with this command - cannot undo!
-- Make sure you delete the right thing, or you could accidentally delete the contents of your computer (it has happened).
-- This command will typically not ask you if you really want to delete. It will just delete . . .

-- Remove tie_fighters 2 and 3.
rm -r tie_fighter_2 tie_fighter_3

// **********************************
Part VIII: The Final Act
// **********************************
-- Touch a file in x_wing called the_force.txt
touch the_force.txt

-- Destroy the death_star and anyone inside of it.
rm -r death_star/

-- Return x_wing and the millenium_falcon to yavin_4
mv millenium_falcon/ ./yavin_4/
mv x_wing/ ./yavin_4/

-- Celebrate!
